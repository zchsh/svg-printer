				<h2>FAQ</h2>

				<details>
					<summary>Why does this exist?</summary>
					<p>
						I made this tool to work with a
						<a href="https://paper-mini.zch.sh/">Paper miniature generator</a>
						that outputs SVGs.
					</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Note on SVG identifier conflicts</summary>
					<p>
						If you're pasting different SVGs, you might see strange shapes and
						images where they shouldn't be. This is a bit technical, but pasted
						SVGs all share the same parent document, so any
						<code>&lt;defs /&gt;</code> or other elements with the same
						<code>id</code> value will cause conflicts.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a fix for this, but so far I've been too lazy to implement
						it... please email me at
						<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a> if you run into it, then
						I'll know it's worth the effort.
					</p>
				</details>

					<summary>How can I support this project?</summary>
					<p>
						If you've gotten something out of the couple of hours of work that
						went into this tool, you can
						<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zchsh">say thanks with money</a>.
						It'll help me buy food and pay rent.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you'd like to contribute code or feedback, you can do that on
						GitHub, at
						<a href="https://github.com/zchsh/svg-printer">zchsh/svg-printer</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The spirit of this project is to make a tool that's free, open
						source, account-less, does one thing really well, and uses file
						formats that are highly interoperable, so that you can use it in
						combination with other tools. It's an attempt at taking a
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"
							>Unix-like philosophy</a
						>
						to writing code for the web.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you like writing code, I'd love to hear your thoughts, or
						collaborate on tools with a similar philosophy. You can reach me at
						<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a>.
