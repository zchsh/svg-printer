				<h2>FAQ</h2>

				<details>
					<summary>Why does this exist?</summary>
					<p>
						Because I'm tired of using complex freemium tools like
						<a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> for simple
						layout-and-print tasks. I wanted something easy and simple that does
						the layout-and-print part quickly and easily, without requiring an
						account or prior design software experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						I originally made this tool to work with a
						<a href="https://paper-mini.zch.sh/">paper miniature generator</a>
						that outputs SVGs.
					</p>

					<summary>
						Why does my printed document look different or scaled down?
					</summary>
					<p>
						If you're seeing issues when trying to print, it's likely related to
						your web browser and browser print settings. A good starting point
						is to check the following settings:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Margins should be set to "None" or zero.</li>
						<li>
							Scale should be set to 100%. Some browsers will use some kind of
							"auto-fit" setting by default, this setting should be disabled.
						</li>
						<li>
							Background graphics should be enabled. Otherwise, images might not
							print at all.
						</li>
						<li>
							Page size should be set to "Letter" or "US Letter", which is 8.5in
							x 11in. This tool currently only works with letter-sized pages. If
							you'd like to print on other page sizes, send an email to
							<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a> and I can work on
							implementing that.
						</li>
						<li>
							"Print headers and footers" or similar settings should be
							disabled.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If you're still seeing issues, you might want to try a different web
						browser. While I usually prefer
						<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>, I've found
						that
						<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> seems to
						have the most reliable print output. Switching between browsers just
						to print something is annoying, so if one browser isn't working
						while another is, consider filing a bug report.
					</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Why do my SVGs get messed up when I paste them?</summary>
					<p>
						If you're pasting different SVGs, you might see strange shapes and
						images where they shouldn't be. This is a bit technical, but pasted
						SVGs all share the same parent document, so any
						<code>&lt;defs /&gt;</code> or other elements with the same
						<code>id</code> value will cause conflicts.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a fix for this, but so far I've been too lazy to implement
						it, because I don't expect many people will use this tool. If you're
						seeing weird issues, please email me at
						<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a>, I'll be happy to help.
					</p>

					<summary>How can I support this project?</summary>
					<p>
						If you've gotten something out of the couple of hours of work that
						went into this tool, you can
						<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zchsh">say thanks with money</a>.
						It'll help me buy food and pay rent.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you'd like to contribute code or feedback, you can do that on
						GitHub, at
						<a href="https://github.com/zchsh/svg-printer">zchsh/svg-printer</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The spirit of this project is to make a tool that's free, open
						source, account-less, does one thing really well, and uses file
						formats that are highly interoperable, so that you can use it in
						combination with other tools. It's an attempt at taking a
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"
							>Unix-like philosophy</a
						>
						to writing code for the web.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you like writing code, I'd love to hear your thoughts, or
						collaborate on tools with a similar philosophy. You can reach me at
						<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a>.
